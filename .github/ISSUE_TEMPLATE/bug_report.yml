      Run `terraform -v` to show the version of Terraform and providers you are 
      using. If you are not running the latest version of Terraform or the 
      providers, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed.

      Please list the resources as a list, for example:
      - opc_instance
      - opc_storage_volume

      If this issue appears to affect multiple resources, it may be an issue with
      Terraform's core, so please mention this.

      No need for code block backticks, this will be rendered as HCL automatically. 
      
      Avoid using `for` loops, dynamics or data sources in your examples as they 
      do not make for a good reproduction test case and may contain bugs in the 
      expressions used.
      
      If you cannot provide your exact configuration due to sensitivity, please
      provide a minimal reproduction case that demonstrates your issue with the setup
      you are using.

      A link to the output (https://gist.github.com) provided from prepending `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to your 
      Terraform apply or plan.  **Do not truncate or trim the output as the surrounding context 
      is useful for debugging and without it, maintainers are restricted in what assistance and 
      diagnosis they can provide**. 
      
      Be sure to redact or sanitise any sensitive information (such as API keys or tokens) in 
      your logs. https://jacobbednarz.com/tf-log-redactor/ is an online tool that will handle
      redacting the sensitive Cloudflare details from your log output for you if you don't want
      to manually do it. Provider versions newer than v3.32.0 automatically redacts all Cloudflare
      credentials.
