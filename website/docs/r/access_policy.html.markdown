# cloudflare_access_policy

Provides a Cloudflare Access Policy resource. Access Policies are used
in conjunction with Access Applications to restrict access to a
particular resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Allowing access to `test@example.com` email address only
resource "cloudflare_access_policy" "test_policy" {
  application_id = "cb029e245cfdd66dc8d2e570d5dd3322"
  zone_id        = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
  name           = "staging policy"
  precedence     = "1"
  decision       = "allow"

  include = {
    email = ["test@example.com"]
  }
}

# Allowing `test@example.com` to access but only when coming from a
# specific IP.
resource "cloudflare_access_policy" "test_policy" {
  application_id = "cb029e245cfdd66dc8d2e570d5dd3322"
  zone_id        = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
  name           = "staging policy"
  precedence     = "1"
  decision       = "allow"

  include = {
    email = ["test@example.com"]
  }

  require = {
    ip = ["${var.office_ip}"]
  }
}
```
