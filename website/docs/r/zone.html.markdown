# cloudflare_zone

Provides a Cloudflare Zone resource. Zone is the basic resource for working with Cloudflare and is roughly equivalent to a domain name that the user purchases.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_zone" "example" {
    zone = "example.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `zone` - (Required) The DNS zone name which will be added.
* `paused` - (Optional) Boolean of whether this zone is paused (traffic bypasses Cloudflare). Default: false.
* `jump_start` - (Optional) Boolean of whether to scan for DNS records on creation. Ignored after zone is created. Default: false.
* `plan` - (Optional) The name of the commercial plan to apply to the zone, can be updated once the one is created; one of `Free Website`, `Pro Website`, `Business Website`, `Enterprise Website`. 

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The zone ID.
* `plan` - The name of the commercial plan to apply to the zone.
* `vanity_name_servers` - List of Vanity Nameservers (if set).
* `meta.wildcard_proxiable` - Indicates whether wildcard DNS records can receive Cloudflare security and performance features.
* `meta.phishing_detected` - Indicates if URLs on the zone have been identified as hosting phishing content.
* `status` - Status of the zone. Valid values: `active`, `pending`, `initializing`, `moved`, `deleted`, `deactivated`
