# cloudflare_access_group

Provides a Cloudflare Access Group resource. Access Groups are used
in conjunction with Access Policies to restrict access to a
particular resource based on group membership.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Allowing access to `test@example.com` email address only
resource "cloudflare_access_group" "test_group" {
  account_id     = "975ecf5a45e3bcb680dba0722a420ad9"
  name           = "staging group"

  include {
    email = ["test@example.com"]
  }
}

# Allowing `test@example.com` to access but only when coming from a
# specific IP.
resource "cloudflare_access_group" "test_group" {
  account_id     = "975ecf5a45e3bcb680dba0722a420ad9"
  name           = "staging group"

  include {
    email = ["test@example.com"]
  }

  require = {
    ip = [var.office_ip]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

-> **Note:** It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in most cases using either is fine. However, if you're using a scoped access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com" zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.

* `account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the account the group is associated with. Conflicts with `zone_id`.
* `zone_id` - (Optional) The ID of the zone the group is associated with. Conflicts with `account_id`.

* `require` - (Optional) A series of access conditions, see below for
  full list.
