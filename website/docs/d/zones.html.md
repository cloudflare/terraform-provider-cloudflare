# cloudflare_zones

Use this data source to look up [Zone][1] records.

## Example Usage

The example below matches all `active` zones that begin with `example.` and are not paused. The matched zones are then
locked down using the `cloudflare_zone_lockdown` resource.

```hcl
data "cloudflare_zones" "test" {
  filter {
    name   = "example.*"
    status = "active"
    paused = false
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_zone_lockdown" "endpoint_lockdown" {
  count       = "${length(data.cloudflare_zones.test.zones)}"
  zone        = "${element(data.cloudflare_zones.test.zones, count.index)}"
  paused      = "false"
  description = "Restrict access to these endpoints to requests from a known IP address"
  urls = [
    "api.mysite.com/some/endpoint*",
  ]
  configurations = [
    {
      "target" = "ip"
      "value" = "198.51.100.4"
    },
  ]
}
```
