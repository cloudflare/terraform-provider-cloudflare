```release-note:internal
resource/cloudflare_list_item: migrate to plugin framework. Due to this migration, we are removing some workaround field values that were previously in place to account for the known zero value issues in the underlying SDKv2. See the release notes for the end user facing changes that need to be made for the internal state migrator to handle the internals.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
resource/cloudflare_list_item: `include_subdomains` is now a boolean value. If you previously set it to `"enabled"`, you should update your configuration to use `true` instead or if you set it to "`disabled`", you should update it to `false`. The rest will be handled by the internal state migrator.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
resource/cloudflare_list_item: `subpath_matching` is now a boolean value. If you previously set it to `"enabled"`, you should update your configuration to use `true` instead or if you set it to "`disabled`", you should update it to `false`. The rest will be handled by the internal state migrator.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
resource/cloudflare_list_item: `preserve_path_suffix` is now a boolean value. If you previously set it to `"enabled"`, you should update your configuration to use `true` instead or if you set it to "`disabled`", you should update it to `false`. The rest will be handled by the internal state migrator.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
resource/cloudflare_list_item: `preserve_query_string` is now a boolean value. If you previously set it to `"enabled"`, you should update your configuration to use `true` instead or if you set it to "`disabled`", you should update it to `false`. The rest will be handled by the internal state migrator.
