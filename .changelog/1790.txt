```release-note:enhancement
resource/cloudflare_access_rule: add support for `account_id`
```

```release-note:note
resource/cloudflare_access_rule: this resource now supports an explicit `account_id` instead of the implied one from the client configuration. You should update your configuration to include `account_id` and remove permadiffs.
```
