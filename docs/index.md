# Cloudflare Provider

The Cloudflare provider is used to interact with resources supported by
Cloudflare. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

## Getting Started

Try the [getting started tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/)
on [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com). In the walk
through, you will setup Terraform and learn to manage Cloudflare resources such
as DNS records, zone settings, load balancers and much more!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Cloudflare provider using the required_providers stanza
# required with Terraform 0.13 and beyond. You may optionally use version
# directive to prevent breaking changes occurring unannounced.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudflare = {
      source  = "cloudflare/cloudflare"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "cloudflare" {
  email   = var.cloudflare_email
  api_key = var.cloudflare_api_key
}

# Create a record
resource "cloudflare_record" "www" {
  # ...
}

# Create a page rule
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "www" {
  # ...
}
```
