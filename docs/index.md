# Cloudflare Provider

The Cloudflare provider is used to interact with resources supported by
Cloudflare. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

## Getting Started

Try the [getting started tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/)
on [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com). In the walk
through, you will setup Terraform and learn to manage Cloudflare resources such
as DNS records, zone settings, load balancers and much more!

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudflare = {
      source  = "cloudflare/cloudflare"
      version = "~> 5"
    }
  }
}

provider "cloudflare" {
  api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token
}

# Create a DNS record
resource "cloudflare_dns_record" "www" {
  # ...
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String) The API key for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` environment variable. API keys are [now considered legacy by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations), API tokens should be used instead. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_token` (String) The API Token for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_user_service_key` (String) A special Cloudflare API key good for a restricted set of endpoints. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_USER_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `base_url` (String) Value to override the default HTTP client base URL. Alternatively, can be configured using the `base_url` environment variable.
- `email` (String) A registered Cloudflare email address. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` environment variable. Required when using `api_key`. Conflicts with `api_token`.
- `user_agent_operator_suffix` (String) A value to append to the HTTP User Agent for all API calls. This value is not something most users need to modify however, if you are using a non-standard provider or operator configuration, this is recommended to assist in uniquely identifying your traffic. **Setting this value will remove the Terraform version from the HTTP User Agent string and may have unintended consequences**. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_USER_AGENT_OPERATOR_SUFFIX` environment variable.
