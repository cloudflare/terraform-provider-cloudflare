# Cloudflare Provider

The Cloudflare provider is used to interact with resources supported by
Cloudflare. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.


!> The 4.x version of the provider is an early release candidate. It may contain
bugs and backwards incompatible state modifications. **You should not use it in
production you are clear on the ramifications and have a clear backup plan in
the event of breakages.**<br><br>For production usage, the 3.x release is
recommended using the `~> 3` provider version selector.

## Getting Started

Try the [getting started tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/)
on [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com). In the walk
through, you will setup Terraform and learn to manage Cloudflare resources such
as DNS records, zone settings, load balancers and much more!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Cloudflare provider using the required_providers stanza
# required with Terraform 0.13 and beyond. You may optionally use version
# directive to prevent breaking changes occurring unannounced.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudflare = {
      source  = "cloudflare/cloudflare"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "cloudflare" {
  api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token
}

# Create a record
resource "cloudflare_record" "www" {
  # ...
}

# Create a page rule
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "www" {
  # ...
}
```

- `api_hostname` (String) Configure the hostname used by the API client. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_HOSTNAME` environment variable.
- `api_key` (String) The API key for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` environment variable. API keys are [now considered legacy by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/keys/#limitations), API tokens should be used instead. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_token` (String) The API Token for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_user_service_key` (String) A special Cloudflare API key good for a restricted set of endpoints. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_USER_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `email` (String) A registered Cloudflare email address. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` environment variable. Required when using `api_key`. Conflicts with `api_token`.
- `max_backoff` (Number) Maximum backoff period in seconds after failed API calls. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_MAX_BACKOFF` environment variable.
- `min_backoff` (Number) Minimum backoff period in seconds after failed API calls. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_MIN_BACKOFF` environment variable.
- `retries` (Number) Maximum number of retries to perform when an API request fails. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_RETRIES` environment variable.
- `rps` (Number) RPS limit to apply when making calls to the API. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_RPS` environment variable.
