  The Cloudflare provider provides resources to interact with the Cloudflare API.

!> v5 of the provider is a ground-up rewrite using code generation from our OpenAPI spec
  and migrating internals to use terraform-plugin-framework.
  <br><br>These are alpha releases that include support for many of the foundational Cloudflare
  products however, is not recommended for existing configurations, critical workloads
  or production usage. There are known bugs that will be addressed as the stability
  increases and we get closer to general availability.
  <br><br>Resources that are expected to work relate to account memberships, zone management,
  DNS records, rulesets and some TLS related products. The failure modes of the resources
  that are not currently supported will vary from diagnostic warnings to potential state
  corruption. At this time, please do not report bugs relating to broken resources as they are
  likely already being worked on to release in upcoming versions. All other feedback can be
  submitted in the GitHub discussion.

# Cloudflare Provider

The Cloudflare provider is used to interact with resources supported by
Cloudflare. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

## Getting Started

Try the [getting started tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/)
on [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com). In the walk
through, you will setup Terraform and learn to manage Cloudflare resources such
as DNS records, zone settings, load balancers and much more!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Cloudflare provider using the required_providers stanza
# required with Terraform 0.13 and beyond. You may optionally use version
# directive to prevent breaking changes occurring unannounced.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudflare = {
      source  = "cloudflare/cloudflare"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "cloudflare" {
  api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token
}

# Create a record
resource "cloudflare_dns_record" "www" {
  # ...
}

# Create a page rule
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "www" {
  # ...
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String) The API key for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` environment variable. API keys are [now considered legacy by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations), API tokens should be used instead. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_token` (String) The API Token for operations. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `api_user_service_key` (String) A special Cloudflare API key good for a restricted set of endpoints. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_USER_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable. Must provide only one of `api_key`, `api_token`, `api_user_service_key`.
- `base_url` (String) Value to override the default HTTP client base URL. Alternatively, can be configured using the `base_url` environment variable.
- `email` (String) A registered Cloudflare email address. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` environment variable. Required when using `api_key`. Conflicts with `api_token`.
- `user_agent_operator_suffix` (String) A value to append to the HTTP User Agent for all API calls. This value is not something most users need to modify however, if you are using a non-standard provider or operator configuration, this is recommended to assist in uniquely identifying your traffic. **Setting this value will remove the Terraform version from the HTTP User Agent string and may have unintended consequences**. Alternatively, can be configured using the `CLOUDFLARE_USER_AGENT_OPERATOR_SUFFIX` environment variable.
