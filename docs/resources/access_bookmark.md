# cloudflare_access_bookmark (Resource)

-> This resource is deprecated in favor of using the [cloudflare_access_application](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/access_application) resource and will be removed in the next major version.

Provides a Cloudflare Access Bookmark resource. Access Bookmark
applications are not protected behind Access but are displayed in
the App Launcher.

~> It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in
most cases using either is fine. However, if you're using a scoped
access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's
scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com"
zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_access_bookmark" "my_bookmark_app" {
  account_id           = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name                 = "My Bookmark App"
  domain               = "example.com"
  logo_url             = "https://example.com/example.png"
  app_launcher_visible = true
}
```
