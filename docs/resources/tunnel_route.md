# cloudflare_tunnel_route (Resource)

Provides a resource, that manages Cloudflare tunnel routes for Zero
Trust. Tunnel routes are used to direct IP traffic through
Cloudflare Tunnels.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Tunnel route
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_route" "example" {
  account_id         = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  tunnel_id          = "f70ff985-a4ef-4643-bbbc-4a0ed4fc8415"
  network            = "192.0.2.24/32"
  comment            = "New tunnel route for documentation"
  virtual_network_id = "bdc39a3c-3104-4c23-8ac0-9f455dda691a"
}

# Tunnel with tunnel route
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared" "tunnel" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "my_tunnel"
  secret     = "AQIDBAUGBwgBAgMEBQYHCAECAwQFBgcIAQIDBAUGBwg="
}

resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_route" "example" {
  account_id         = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  tunnel_id          = cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared.tunnel.id
  network            = "192.0.2.24/32"
  comment            = "New tunnel route for documentation"
