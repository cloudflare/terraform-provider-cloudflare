# cloudflare_worker_cron_trigger (Resource)

Worker Cron Triggers allow users to map a cron expression to a Worker script
using a `ScheduledEvent` listener that enables Workers to be executed on a
schedule. Worker Cron Triggers are ideal for running periodic jobs for
maintenance or calling third-party APIs to collect up-to-date data.

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_worker_script" "example_script" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "example-script"
  content    = file("path/to/my.js")
}

resource "cloudflare_worker_cron_trigger" "example_trigger" {
  account_id  = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  script_name = cloudflare_worker_script.example_script.name
  schedules = [
    "*/5 * * * *",      # every 5 minutes
    "10 7 * * mon-fri", # 7:10am every weekday
