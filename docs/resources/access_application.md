# cloudflare_access_application (Resource)

Provides a Cloudflare Access Application resource. Access
Applications are used to restrict access to a whole application using an
authorisation gateway managed by Cloudflare.

~> It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in
most cases using either is fine. However, if you're using a scoped
access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's
scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com"
zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.
