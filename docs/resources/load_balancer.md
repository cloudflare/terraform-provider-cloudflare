# cloudflare_load_balancer (Resource)

Provides a Cloudflare Load Balancer resource. This sits in front of
a number of defined pools of origins and provides various options
for geographically-aware load balancing. Note that the load balancing
feature must be enabled in your Cloudflare account before you can use
this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Define a load balancer which always points to a pool we define below.
# In normal usage, would have different pools set for different pops
# (cloudflare points-of-presence) and/or for different regions.
# Within each pop or region we can define multiple pools in failover order.
resource "cloudflare_load_balancer" "example" {
  zone_id          = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  name             = "example-load-balancer.example.com"
  fallback_pool_id = cloudflare_load_balancer_pool.example.id
  default_pool_ids = [cloudflare_load_balancer_pool.example.id]
  description      = "example load balancer using geo-balancing"
  proxied          = true
  steering_policy  = "geo"

  pop_pools {
    pop      = "LAX"
    pool_ids = [cloudflare_load_balancer_pool.example.id]
  }

  country_pools {
    country  = "US"
    pool_ids = [cloudflare_load_balancer_pool.example.id]
  }

  region_pools {
    region   = "WNAM"
    pool_ids = [cloudflare_load_balancer_pool.example.id]
  }

  rules {
    name      = "example rule"
    condition = "http.request.uri.path contains \"testing\""
    fixed_response {
      message_body = "hello"
      status_code  = 200
      content_type = "html"
      location     = "www.example.com"
    }
  }
}

    name    = "example-1"
    address = "192.0.2.1"
    enabled = false
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `default_pool_ids` (List of String) A list of pool IDs ordered by their failover priority. Used whenever [`pop_pools`](#pop_pools)/[`country_pools`](#country_pools)/[`region_pools`](#region_pools) are not defined.
- `fallback_pool_id` (String) The pool ID to use when all other pools are detected as unhealthy.
- `name` (String) The DNS hostname to associate with your load balancer. If this hostname already exists as a DNS record in Cloudflare's DNS, the load balancer will take precedence and the DNS record will not be used.
- `zone_id` (String) The zone ID to add the load balancer to. **Modifying this attribute will force creation of a new resource.**

### Optional

- `adaptive_routing` (Block Set) Controls features that modify the routing of requests to pools and origins in response to dynamic conditions, such as during the interval between active health monitoring requests. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--adaptive_routing))
- `country_pools` (Block Set) A set containing mappings of country codes to a list of pool IDs (ordered by their failover priority) for the given country. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--country_pools))
- `description` (String) Free text description.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable the load balancer. Defaults to `true`.
- `location_strategy` (Block Set) Controls location-based steering for non-proxied requests. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--location_strategy))
- `pop_pools` (Block Set) A set containing mappings of Cloudflare Point-of-Presence (PoP) identifiers to a list of pool IDs (ordered by their failover priority) for the PoP (datacenter). This feature is only available to enterprise customers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--pop_pools))
- `proxied` (Boolean) Whether the hostname gets Cloudflare's origin protection. Defaults to `false`. Conflicts with `ttl`.
- `random_steering` (Block Set) Configures pool weights for random steering. When the [`steering_policy="random"`](#steering_policy), a random pool is selected with probability proportional to these pool weights. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--random_steering))
- `region_pools` (Block Set) A set containing mappings of region codes to a list of pool IDs (ordered by their failover priority) for the given region. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--region_pools))
- `rules` (Block List) A list of rules for this load balancer to execute. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules))
- `session_affinity` (String) Specifies the type of session affinity the load balancer should use unless specified as `none` or `""` (default). With value `cookie`, on the first request to a proxied load balancer, a cookie is generated, encoding information of which origin the request will be forwarded to. Subsequent requests, by the same client to the same load balancer, will be sent to the origin server the cookie encodes, for the duration of the cookie and as long as the origin server remains healthy. If the cookie has expired or the origin server is unhealthy then a new origin server is calculated and used. Value `ip_cookie` behaves the same as `cookie` except the initial origin selection is stable and based on the client's IP address. Available values: `""`, `none`, `cookie`, `ip_cookie`. Defaults to `none`.
- `session_affinity_attributes` (Map of String) See [`session_affinity_attributes`](#nested-schema-for-session_affinity_attributes).
- `session_affinity_ttl` (Number) Time, in seconds, until this load balancer's session affinity cookie expires after being created. This parameter is ignored unless a supported session affinity policy is set. The current default of `82800` (23 hours) will be used unless [`session_affinity_ttl`](#session_affinity_ttl) is explicitly set. Once the expiry time has been reached, subsequent requests may get sent to a different origin server. Valid values are between `1800` and `604800`.
- `steering_policy` (String) The method the load balancer uses to determine the route to your origin. Value `off` uses [`default_pool_ids`](#default_pool_ids). Value `geo` uses [`pop_pools`](#pop_pools)/[`country_pools`](#country_pools)/[`region_pools`](#region_pools). For non-proxied requests, the [`country`](#country) for [`country_pools`](#country_pools) is determined by [`location_strategy`](#location_strategy). Value `random` selects a pool randomly. Value `dynamic_latency` uses round trip time to select the closest pool in [`default_pool_ids`](#default_pool_ids) (requires pool health checks). Value `proximity` uses the pools' latitude and longitude to select the closest pool using the Cloudflare PoP location for proxied requests or the location determined by [`location_strategy`](#location_strategy) for non-proxied requests. Value `""` maps to `geo` if you use [`pop_pools`](#pop_pools)/[`country_pools`](#country_pools)/[`region_pools`](#region_pools) otherwise `off`. Available values: `off`, `geo`, `dynamic_latency`, `random`, `proximity`, `""` Defaults to `""`.
- `ttl` (Number) Time to live (TTL) of the DNS entry for the IP address returned by this load balancer. This cannot be set for proxied load balancers. Defaults to `30`. Conflicts with `proxied`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `modified_on` (String) The RFC3339 timestamp of when the load balancer was last modified.

Optional:
