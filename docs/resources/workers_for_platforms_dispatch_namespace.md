## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Identifier.

### Optional

- `name` (String) The name of the dispatch namespace.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) Identifier.
- `created_on` (String) When the script was created.
- `id` (String) Name of the Workers for Platforms dispatch namespace.
- `modified_by` (String) Identifier.
- `modified_on` (String) When the script was last modified.
- `namespace_id` (String) API Resource UUID tag.
- `namespace_name` (String) Name of the Workers for Platforms dispatch namespace.
- `script_count` (Number) The current number of scripts in this Dispatch Namespace.
- `trusted_workers` (Boolean) Whether the Workers in the namespace are executed in a "trusted" manner. When a Worker is trusted, it has access to the shared caches for the zone in the Cache API, and has access to the `request.cf` object on incoming Requests. When a Worker is untrusted, caches are not shared across the zone, and `request.cf` is undefined. By default, Workers in a namespace are "untrusted".

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_workers_for_platforms_dispatch_namespace.example '<account_id>/<dispatch_namespace>'
```
