# cloudflare_access_mutual_tls_certificate (Resource)



~> It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in
   most cases using either is fine. However, if you're using a scoped
   access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's
   scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com"
   zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_access_mutual_tls_certificate" "my_cert" {
  zone_id              = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  name                 = "My Root Cert"
  certificate          = var.ca_pem
  associated_hostnames = ["staging.example.com"]
}
```
