# cloudflare_certificate_pack (Resource)



~> Certificate packs are not able to be updated in place. If
you require a zero downtime rotation, you can create multiple
resources using a 2-phase change where you have both resources
live at once and you remove the old one once you've confirmed
the certificate is available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_certificate_pack" "example_certificate_pack" {
  zone_id = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
  certificate_authority = "lets_encrypt"
  hosts = ["example.com", "*.example.com", "www.example.com"]
  type = "advanced"
  validation_method = "txt"
  validity_days = 14
  cloudflare_branding = false
}
```
<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```

While supported, importing isn't recommended and it is advised to replace the
certificate entirely instead.
