# cloudflare_certificate_pack (Resource)



~> Certificate packs are not able to be updated in place and if
you require a zero downtime rotation, you need to use Terraform's meta-arguments
for [`lifecycle`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#lifecycle-lifecycle-customizations) blocks.
`create_before_destroy` should be suffice for most scenarios (exceptions are
things like missing entitlements, high ranking domain). To completely
de-risk rotations, use you can create multiple resources using a 2-phase change
where you have both resources live at once and you remove the old one once
you've confirmed the certificate is available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_certificate_pack" "example_certificate_pack" {
  zone_id = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
  certificate_authority = "lets_encrypt"
  hosts = ["example.com", "*.example.com", "www.example.com"]
  type = "advanced"
  validation_method = "txt"
  validity_days = 14
  cloudflare_branding = false
}
```
