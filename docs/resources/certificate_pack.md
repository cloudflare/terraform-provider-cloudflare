# cloudflare_certificate_pack (Resource)



~> Certificate packs are not able to be updated in place and if
you require a zero downtime rotation, you need to use Terraform's meta-arguments
for [`lifecycle`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#lifecycle-lifecycle-customizations) blocks.
`create_before_destroy` should be suffice for most scenarios (exceptions are
things like missing entitlements, high ranking domain). To completely
de-risk rotations, use you can create multiple resources using a 2-phase change
where you have both resources live at once and you remove the old one once
you've confirmed the certificate is available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Advanced certificate manager for DigiCert
resource "cloudflare_certificate_pack" "example" {
  zone_id               = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  type                  = "advanced"
  hosts                 = ["example.com", "sub.example.com"]
  validation_method     = "txt"
  validity_days         = 30
  certificate_authority = "digicert"
  cloudflare_branding   = false
}

# Advanced certificate manager for Let's Encrypt
resource "cloudflare_certificate_pack" "example" {
  zone_id                = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  type                   = "advanced"
  hosts                  = ["example.com", "*.example.com"]
  validation_method      = "http"
  validity_days          = 90
  certificate_authority  = "lets_encrypt"
  cloudflare_branding    = false
  wait_for_active_status = true
}
```
