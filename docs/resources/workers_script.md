## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Identifier
- `script_name` (String) Name of the script, used in URLs and route configuration.

### Optional

- `any_part_name` (List of String) A module comprising a Worker script, often a javascript file. Multiple modules may be provided as separate named parts, but at least one module must be present and referenced in the metadata as `main_module` or `body_part` by part name. Source maps may also be included using the `application/source-map` content type.
- `message` (String) Rollback message to be associated with this deployment. Only parsed when query param `"rollback_to"` is present.
- `metadata` (Attributes) JSON encoded metadata about the uploaded parts and Worker configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `created_on` (String) When the script was created.
- `etag` (String) Hashed script content, can be used in a If-None-Match header when updating.
- `has_assets` (Boolean) Whether a Worker contains assets.
- `has_modules` (Boolean) Whether a Worker contains modules.
- `id` (String) Name of the script, used in URLs and route configuration.
- `logpush` (Boolean) Whether Logpush is turned on for the Worker.
- `modified_on` (String) When the script was last modified.
- `placement_mode` (String) Specifies the placement mode for the Worker (e.g. 'smart').
- `startup_time_ms` (Number)
- `tail_consumers` (Attributes List) List of Workers that will consume logs from the attached Worker. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tail_consumers))
- `usage_model` (String) Specifies the usage model for the Worker (e.g. 'bundled' or 'unbound').

- `compatibility_date` (String) Date indicating targeted support in the Workers runtime. Backwards incompatible fixes to the runtime following this date will not affect this Worker.
- `compatibility_flags` (List of String) Flags that enable or disable certain features in the Workers runtime. Used to enable upcoming features or opt in or out of specific changes not included in a `compatibility_date`.

- `keep_bindings` (List of String) List of binding types to keep from previous_upload.
- `logpush` (Boolean) Whether Logpush is turned on for the Worker.
- `main_module` (String) Name of the part in the multipart request that contains the main module (e.g. the file exporting a `fetch` handler). Indicates a `module syntax` Worker.
