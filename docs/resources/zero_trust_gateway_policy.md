## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String)
- `action` (String) The action to preform when the associated traffic, identity, and device posture expressions are either absent or evaluate to `true`.
Available values: "on", "off", "allow", "block", "scan", "noscan", "safesearch", "ytrestricted", "isolate", "noisolate", "override", "l4_override", "egress", "resolve", "quarantine", "redirect".
- `name` (String) The name of the rule.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the rule.
- `device_posture` (String) The wirefilter expression used for device posture check matching.
- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the rule is enabled.
- `expiration` (Attributes) The expiration time stamp and default duration of a DNS policy. Takes
precedence over the policy's `schedule` configuration, if any.

This does not apply to HTTP or network policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--expiration))
- `filters` (List of String) The protocol or layer to evaluate the traffic, identity, and device posture expressions.
- `identity` (String) The wirefilter expression used for identity matching.
- `precedence` (Number) Precedence sets the order of your rules. Lower values indicate higher precedence. At each processing phase, applicable rules are evaluated in ascending order of this value.
- `rule_settings` (Attributes) Additional settings that modify the rule's action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings))
- `schedule` (Attributes) The schedule for activating DNS policies. This does not apply to HTTP or network policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))
- `traffic` (String) The wirefilter expression used for traffic matching.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String)
- `deleted_at` (String) Date of deletion, if any.
- `id` (String) The API resource UUID.
- `updated_at` (String)
- `version` (Number) version number of the rule

<a id="nestedatt--expiration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `expiration`

Required:

- `expires_at` (String) The time stamp at which the policy will expire and cease to be
applied.

Must adhere to RFC 3339 and include a UTC offset. Non-zero
offsets are accepted but will be converted to the equivalent
value with offset zero (UTC+00:00) and will be returned as time
stamps with offset zero denoted by a trailing 'Z'.

Policies with an expiration do not consider the timezone of
clients they are applied to, and expire "globally" at the point
given by their `expires_at` value.

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) The default duration a policy will be active in minutes. Must be set in order to use the `reset_expiration` endpoint on this rule.
- `expired` (Boolean) Whether the policy has expired.


<a id="nestedatt--rule_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_settings`

Optional:

- `add_headers` (Map of String) Add custom headers to allowed requests, in the form of key-value pairs. Keys are header names, pointing to an array with its header value(s).
- `allow_child_bypass` (Boolean) Set by parent MSP accounts to enable their children to bypass this rule.
- `audit_ssh` (Attributes) Settings for the Audit SSH action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--audit_ssh))
- `biso_admin_controls` (Attributes) Configure how browser isolation behaves. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--biso_admin_controls))

- `check_session` (Attributes) Configure how session check behaves. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--check_session))
- `dns_resolvers` (Attributes) Add your own custom resolvers to route queries that match the resolver policy. Cannot be used when 'resolve_dns_through_cloudflare' or 'resolve_dns_internally' are set. DNS queries will route to the address closest to their origin. Only valid when a rule's action is set to 'resolve'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--dns_resolvers))
- `egress` (Attributes) Configure how Gateway Proxy traffic egresses. You can enable this setting for rules with Egress actions and filters, or omit it to indicate local egress via WARP IPs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--egress))
- `ignore_cname_category_matches` (Boolean) Set to true, to ignore the category matches at CNAME domains in a response. If unchecked, the categories in this rule will be checked against all the CNAME domain categories in a response.
- `insecure_disable_dnssec_validation` (Boolean) INSECURE - disable DNSSEC validation (for Allow actions).
- `ip_categories` (Boolean) Set to true to enable IPs in DNS resolver category blocks. By default categories only block based on domain names.

- `redirect` (Attributes) Settings that apply to redirect rules (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--redirect))
- `resolve_dns_internally` (Attributes) Configure to forward the query to the internal DNS service, passing the specified 'view_id' as input. Cannot be set when 'dns_resolvers' are specified or 'resolve_dns_through_cloudflare' is set. Only valid when a rule's action is set to 'resolve'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--resolve_dns_internally))
- `resolve_dns_through_cloudflare` (Boolean) Enable to send queries that match the policy to Cloudflare's default 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver. Cannot be set when 'dns_resolvers' are specified or 'resolve_dns_internally' is set. Only valid when a rule's action is set to 'resolve'.
