# cloudflare_address_map (Resource)

Provides the ability to manage IP addresses that can be used by DNS records when
they are proxied through Cloudflare.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_address_map" "example" {
  account_id  = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  description = "My address map"
  default_sni = "*.example.com"
  enabled     = true

  ips { ip = "192.0.2.1" }
  ips { ip = "203.0.113.1" }

  memberships {
    identifier = "92f17202ed8bd63d69a66b86a49a8f6b"
    kind       = "account"
  }
  memberships {
    identifier = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
    kind       = "zone"

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) The account identifier to target for the resource.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the Address Map is enabled or not.

### Optional

- `default_sni` (String) If you have legacy TLS clients which do not send the TLS server name indicator, then you can specify one default SNI on the map.
- `description` (String) Description of the address map.
- `ips` (Block Set) The set of IPs on the Address Map. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ips))
- `memberships` (Block Set) Zones and Accounts which will be assigned IPs on this Address Map. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--memberships))

### Read-Only

- `can_delete` (Boolean) If set to false, then the Address Map cannot be deleted via API. This is true for Cloudflare-managed maps.
- `can_modify_ips` (Boolean) If set to false, then the IPs on the Address Map cannot be modified via the API. This is true for Cloudflare-managed maps.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--ips"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ips`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_address_map.example <account_id>/<address_map_id>
```

For terraform 1.5 and later, you should use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import):
```terraform
import {
    to = cloudflare_address_map.example
    id = "<account_id>/<address_map_id>"
}
```
