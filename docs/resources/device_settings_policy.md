## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String)
- `match` (String) The wirefilter expression to match devices.
- `name` (String) The name of the device settings profile.
- `precedence` (Number) The precedence of the policy. Lower values indicate higher precedence. Policies will be evaluated in ascending order of this field.

### Optional

- `allow_mode_switch` (Boolean) Whether to allow the user to switch WARP between modes.
- `allow_updates` (Boolean) Whether to receive update notifications when a new version of the client is available.
- `allowed_to_leave` (Boolean) Whether to allow devices to leave the organization.
- `auto_connect` (Number) The amount of time in minutes to reconnect after having been disabled.
- `captive_portal` (Number) Turn on the captive portal after the specified amount of time.
- `description` (String) A description of the policy.
- `disable_auto_fallback` (Boolean) If the `dns_server` field of a fallback domain is not present, the client will fall back to a best guess of the default/system DNS resolvers unless this policy option is set to `true`.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the policy will be applied to matching devices.
- `exclude_office_ips` (Boolean) Whether to add Microsoft IPs to Split Tunnel exclusions.
- `lan_allow_minutes` (Number) The amount of time in minutes a user is allowed access to their LAN. A value of 0 will allow LAN access until the next WARP reconnection, such as a reboot or a laptop waking from sleep. Note that this field is omitted from the response if null or unset.
- `lan_allow_subnet_size` (Number) The size of the subnet for the local access network. Note that this field is omitted from the response if null or unset.
- `policy_id` (String) Device ID.
- `service_mode_v2` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service_mode_v2))
- `support_url` (String) The URL to launch when the Send Feedback button is clicked.
- `switch_locked` (Boolean) Whether to allow the user to turn off the WARP switch and disconnect the client.
