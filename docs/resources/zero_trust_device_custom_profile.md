- `precedence` (Number) The precedence of the policy. Lower values indicate higher precedence. Policies will be evaluated in ascending order of this field.

### Optional

- `allow_mode_switch` (Boolean) Whether to allow the user to switch WARP between modes.
- `allow_updates` (Boolean) Whether to receive update notifications when a new version of the client is available.
- `allowed_to_leave` (Boolean) Whether to allow devices to leave the organization.
- `auto_connect` (Number) The amount of time in seconds to reconnect after having been disabled.
