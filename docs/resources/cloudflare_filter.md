  zone_id = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
  description = "Wordpress break-in attempts that are outside of the office"
  expression = "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `zone_id` - (Required) The DNS zone to which the Filter should be added.
- `paused` - (Optional) Whether this filter is currently paused. Boolean value.
- `expression` - (Required) The filter expression to be used.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

```

where:
