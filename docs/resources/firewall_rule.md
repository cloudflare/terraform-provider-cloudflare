# cloudflare_firewall_rule (Resource)



~> `cloudflare_firewall_rule` is in a deprecation phase until January 15th, 2025.
  During this time period, this resource is still
  fully supported but you are strongly advised  to move to the
  `cloudflare_ruleset` resource. Full details can be found in the
  [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/migration-guides/firewall-rules-to-custom-rules/#relevant-changes-for-terraform-users).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_filter" "wordpress" {
  zone_id     = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  description = "Wordpress break-in attempts that are outside of the office"
  expression  = "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1"
}

resource "cloudflare_firewall_rule" "wordpress" {
  zone_id     = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  description = "Block wordpress break-in attempts"
  filter_id   = cloudflare_filter.wordpress.id
  action      = "block"
}
```

- `path_id` (String) The unique identifier of the firewall rule.

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) An informative summary of the firewall rule.
- `paused` (Boolean) When true, indicates that the firewall rule is currently paused.

### Nested Schema for `action`

Optional:

- `mode` (String) The action to perform.
- `response` (Attributes) A custom content type and reponse to return when the threshold is exceeded. The custom response configured in this object will override the custom error for the zone. This object is optional.
Notes: If you omit this object, Cloudflare will use the default HTML error page. If "mode" is "challenge", "managed_challenge", or "js_challenge", Cloudflare will use the zone challenge pages and you should not provide the "response" object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--action--response))
- `timeout` (Number) The time in seconds during which Cloudflare will perform the mitigation action. Must be an integer value greater than or equal to the period.
Notes: If "mode" is "challenge", "managed_challenge", or "js_challenge", Cloudflare will use the zone's Challenge Passage time and you should not provide this value.
