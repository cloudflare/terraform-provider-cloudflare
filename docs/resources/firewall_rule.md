# cloudflare_firewall_rule (Resource)

Define Firewall rules using filter expressions for more control over
how traffic is matched to the rule. A filter expression permits
selecting traffic by multiple criteria allowing greater freedom in
rule creation.

Filter expressions needs to be created first before using Firewall
Rule.
