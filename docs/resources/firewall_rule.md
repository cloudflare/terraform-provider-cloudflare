# cloudflare_firewall_rule (Resource)

Define Firewall rules using filter expressions for more control over
how traffic is matched to the rule. A filter expression permits
selecting traffic by multiple criteria allowing greater freedom in
rule creation.

Filter expressions needs to be created first before using Firewall
Rule.

~> `cloudflare_firewall_rule` is in a deprecation phase that will last for 14
  months (July 1st, 2024). During this time period, this resource is still
  fully supported but you are strongly advised  to move to the
  `cloudflare_ruleset` resource. Full details can be found in the
  [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/migration-guides/firewall-rules-to-custom-rules/#relevant-changes-for-terraform-users).

## Example Usage

```terraform

  zone_id     = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  description = "Wordpress break-in attempts that are outside of the office"
  expression  = "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1"
}
