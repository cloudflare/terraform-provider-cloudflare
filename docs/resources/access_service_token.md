# cloudflare_access_service_token (Resource)

Access Service Tokens are used for service-to-service communication
when an application is behind Cloudflare Access.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_access_service_token" "my_app" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "CI/CD app"
}

# Generate a service token that will renew if terraform is ran within 30 days of expiration
resource "cloudflare_access_service_token" "my_app" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "CI/CD app renewed"

  min_days_for_renewal = 30

  # This flag is important to set if min_days_for_renewal is defined otherwise
  # there will be a brief period where the service relying on that token
  # will not have access due to the resource being deleted
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Friendly name of the token's intent.

### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The account identifier to target for the resource. Conflicts with `zone_id`.
- `duration` (String) Length of time the service token is valid for. Available values: `8760h`, `17520h`, `43800h`, `87600h`, `forever`.
- `min_days_for_renewal` (Number) Refresh the token if terraform is run within the specified amount of days before expiration. Defaults to `0`.
- `zone_id` (String) The zone identifier to target for the resource. Conflicts with `account_id`.

### Read-Only

- `client_id` (String) UUID client ID associated with the Service Token. **Modifying this attribute will force creation of a new resource.**
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) A secret for interacting with Access protocols. **Modifying this attribute will force creation of a new resource.**
- `expires_at` (String) Date when the token expires.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# If you are importing an Access Service Token you will not have the
# client_secret available in the state for use. The client_secret is only
# available once, at creation. In most cases, it is better to just create a new
# resource should you need to reference it in other resources.
$ terraform import cloudflare_access_service_token.example <account_id>/<service_token_id>
```
