# cloudflare_access_service_token (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_access_service_token" "my_app" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "CI/CD app"
}

# Generate a service token that will renew if terraform is ran within 30 days of expiration
resource "cloudflare_access_service_token" "my_app" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "CI/CD app renewed"

  min_days_for_renewal = 30

  # This flag is important to set if min_days_for_renewal is defined otherwise
  # there will be a brief period where the service relying on that token
  # will not have access due to the resource being deleted
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the service token.

### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The Account ID to use for this endpoint. Mutually exclusive with the Zone ID.
- `duration` (String) The duration for how long the service token will be valid. Must be in the format `300ms` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are: ns, us (or Âµs), ms, s, m, h. The default is 1 year in hours (8760h).
- `zone_id` (String) The Zone ID to use for this endpoint. Mutually exclusive with the Account ID.

### Read-Only

- `client_id` (String) The Client ID for the service token. Access will check for this value in the `CF-Access-Client-ID` request header.
- `client_secret` (String) The Client Secret for the service token. Access will check for this value in the `CF-Access-Client-Secret` request header.
- `created_at` (String)
- `id` (String) The ID of the service token.
- `updated_at` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# If you are importing an Access Service Token you will not have the
# client_secret available in the state for use. The client_secret is only
# available once, at creation. In most cases, it is better to just create a new
# resource should you need to reference it in other resources.
$ terraform import cloudflare_access_service_token.example <account_id>/<service_token_id>
```
