## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Account ID.
- `name` (String) Name of the bucket.

### Optional

- `jurisdiction` (String) Jurisdiction where objects in this bucket are guaranteed to be stored.
Available values: "default", "eu", "fedramp".
- `location` (String) Location of the bucket.
Available values: "apac", "eeur", "enam", "weur", "wnam", "oc".  Note: `location` is only honored the first time a bucket with a given name is created. If you delete and recreate a bucket with the same name, the original bucket location will be used. It is also a best-effort, not a guarantee, of bucket location.

Available values: "Standard", "InfrequentAccess".

### Read-Only

- `creation_date` (String) Creation timestamp.
- `id` (String) Name of the bucket.

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_r2_bucket.example '<account_id>/<bucket_name>/<jurisdiction>'
```
