# cloudflare_zero_trust_device_managed_networks (Resource)

Provides a Cloudflare Device Managed Network resource. Device managed networks allow for building location-aware device settings policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_managed_networks" "managed_networks" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "managed-network-1"
  type       = "tls"
  config {
    tls_sockaddr = "foobar:1234"
    sha256       = "b5bb9d8014a0f9b1d61e21e796d78dccdf1352f23cd32812f4850b878ae4944c"
  }
}
```
<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) The account identifier to target for the resource.
- `config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The configuration containing information for the WARP client to detect the managed network. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config))
- `name` (String) The name of the Device Managed Network. Must be unique.
- `type` (String) The type of Device Managed Network. Available values: `tls`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config`

Required:

- `sha256` (String) The SHA-256 hash of the TLS certificate presented by the host found at tls_sockaddr. If absent, regular certificate verification (trusted roots, valid timestamp, etc) will be used to validate the certificate.
- `tls_sockaddr` (String) A network address of the form "host:port" that the WARP client will use to detect the presence of a TLS host.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_zero_trust_device_managed_networks.example <account_id>/<device_managed_networks_id>
```
