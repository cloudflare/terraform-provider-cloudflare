# cloudflare_filter (Resource)

Filter expressions that can be referenced across multiple features,
e.g. Firewall Rules. See [what is a filter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-filters/what-is-a-filter/)
for more details and available fields and operators.

~> `cloudflare_filter` is in a deprecation phase until January 15th, 2025.
  During this time period, this resource is still fully
  supported but you are strongly advised to move to the
  `cloudflare_ruleset` resource. Full details can be found in the
  [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/migration-guides/firewall-rules-to-custom-rules/#relevant-changes-for-terraform-users).

  expression  = "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1"
