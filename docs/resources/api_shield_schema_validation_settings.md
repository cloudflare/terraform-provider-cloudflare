# cloudflare_api_shield_schema_validation_settings (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_api_shield_schema_validation_settings" "example" {
  zone_id                               = "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711"
  validation_default_mitigation_action  = "log"
  validation_override_mitigation_action = "none"
}
```
<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `validation_default_mitigation_action` (String) The default mitigation action used when there is no mitigation action defined on the operation

Mitigation actions are as follows:

  * `log` - log request when request does not conform to schema
  * `block` - deny access to the site when request does not conform to schema

A special value of of `none` will skip running schema validation entirely for the request when there is no mitigation action defined on the operation
- `zone_id` (String) Identifier

### Optional

- `validation_override_mitigation_action` (String) When set, this overrides both zone level and operation level mitigation actions.

  - `none` will skip running schema validation entirely for the request
  - `null` indicates that no override is in place

To clear any override, use the special value `disable_override` or `null`
