# cloudflare_zone (Resource)

Provides a Cloudflare Zone resource. Zone is the basic resource for
working with Cloudflare and is roughly equivalent to a domain name
that the user purchases.

-> If you are attempting to sign up a subdomain of a zone you must first have Subdomain Support entitlement for your account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_zone" "example" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  zone       = "example.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `jump_start` (Boolean) Whether to scan for DNS records on creation. Ignored after zone is created.
- `paused` (Boolean) Whether this zone is paused (traffic bypasses Cloudflare). Defaults to `false`.

- `type` (String) A full zone implies that DNS is hosted with Cloudflare. A partial zone is typically a partner-hosted zone or a CNAME setup. Available values: `full`, `partial`, `secondary`. Defaults to `full`.
- `vanity_name_servers` (List of String) List of Vanity Nameservers (if set).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

- `name_servers` (List of String) Cloudflare-assigned name servers. This is only populated for zones that use Cloudflare DNS.
- `status` (String) Status of the zone. Available values: `active`, `pending`, `initializing`, `moved`, `deleted`, `deactivated`.
