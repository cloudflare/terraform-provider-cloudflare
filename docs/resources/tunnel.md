# cloudflare_tunnel (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_tunnel" "example" {
  account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
  name       = "my-tunnel"
  secret     = "AQIDBAUGBwgBAgMEBQYHCAECAwQFBgcIAQIDBAUGBwg="

```
<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Cloudflare account ID
- `name` (String) A user-friendly name for a tunnel.
- `tunnel_secret` (String) Sets the password required to run a locally-managed tunnel. Must be at least 32 bytes and encoded as a base64 string.

### Read-Only

- `connections` (Attributes List) The tunnel connections between your origin and Cloudflare's edge. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--connections))
- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of when the resource was created.
- `deleted_at` (String) Timestamp of when the resource was deleted. If `null`, the resource has not been deleted.
- `id` (String) UUID of the tunnel.

### Nested Schema for `connections`

Optional:

- `colo_name` (String) The Cloudflare data center used for this connection.
- `is_pending_reconnect` (Boolean) Cloudflare continues to track connections for several minutes after they disconnect. This is an optimization to improve latency and reliability of reconnecting.  If `true`, the connection has disconnected but is still being tracked. If `false`, the connection is actively serving traffic.

Read-Only:

- `uuid` (String) UUID of the Cloudflare Tunnel connection.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_tunnel.example <account_id>/<tunnel_id>
```
