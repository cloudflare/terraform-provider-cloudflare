- `id` (String) UUID
- `name` (String) The name of the identity provider, shown to users on the login page.
- `scim_config` (Attributes) The configuration settings for enabling a System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) with the identity provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--scim_config))
- `type` (String) The type of identity provider. To determine the value for a specific provider, refer to our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/).

- `certs_url` (String) The jwks_uri endpoint of your IdP to allow the IdP keys to sign the tokens
- `claims` (List of String) Custom claims
- `client_id` (String) Your OAuth Client ID
- `client_secret` (String) Your OAuth Client Secret
- `conditional_access_enabled` (Boolean) Should Cloudflare try to load authentication contexts from your account

- `email_attribute_name` (String) The attribute name for email in the SAML response.
- `email_claim_name` (String) The claim name for email in the id_token response.
- `header_attributes` (Attributes List) Add a list of attribute names that will be returned in the response header from the Access callback. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--config--header_attributes))
