<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Identifier
- `list_id` (String) The unique ID of the list.

### Optional

- `cursor` (String) The pagination cursor. An opaque string token indicating the position from which to continue when requesting the next/previous set of records. Cursor values are provided under `result_info.cursors` in the response. You should make no assumptions about a cursor's content or length.
- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000
- `per_page` (Number) Amount of results to include in each paginated response. A non-negative 32 bit integer.
- `search` (String) A search query to filter returned items. Its meaning depends on the list type: IP addresses must start with the provided string, hostnames and bulk redirects must contain the string, and ASNs must match the string exactly.

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) The items returned by the data source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
