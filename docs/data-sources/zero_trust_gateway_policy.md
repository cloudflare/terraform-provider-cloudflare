<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `account_id` (String)
- `filter` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))
- `rule_id` (String) The API resource UUID.

### Read-Only

- `action` (String) The action to preform when the associated traffic, identity, and device posture expressions are either absent or evaluate to `true`.
- `created_at` (String)
- `deleted_at` (String) Date of deletion, if any.
- `description` (String) The description of the rule.
- `device_posture` (String) The wirefilter expression used for device posture check matching.
- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the rule is enabled.
- `expiration` (Attributes) The expiration time stamp and default duration of a DNS policy. Takes
precedence over the policy's `schedule` configuration, if any.

This does not apply to HTTP or network policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--expiration))
- `filters` (List of String) The protocol or layer to evaluate the traffic, identity, and device posture expressions.
- `id` (String) The API resource UUID.
- `identity` (String) The wirefilter expression used for identity matching.
- `name` (String) The name of the rule.
- `precedence` (Number) Precedence sets the order of your rules. Lower values indicate higher precedence. At each processing phase, applicable rules are evaluated in ascending order of this value.
- `rule_settings` (Attributes) Additional settings that modify the rule's action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings))
- `schedule` (Attributes) The schedule for activating DNS policies. This does not apply to HTTP or network policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))
- `traffic` (String) The wirefilter expression used for traffic matching.
- `updated_at` (String)

### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `account_id` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--expiration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `expiration`

Read-Only:

- `duration` (Number) The default duration a policy will be active in minutes. Must be set in order to use the `reset_expiration` endpoint on this rule.
- `expires_at` (String) The time stamp at which the policy will expire and cease to be
applied.

Must adhere to RFC 3339 and include a UTC offset. Non-zero
offsets are accepted but will be converted to the equivalent
value with offset zero (UTC+00:00) and will be returned as time
stamps with offset zero denoted by a trailing 'Z'.

Policies with an expiration do not consider the timezone of
clients they are applied to, and expire "globally" at the point
given by their `expires_at` value.


<a id="nestedatt--rule_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_settings`

Read-Only:

- `add_headers` (Map of String) Add custom headers to allowed requests, in the form of key-value pairs. Keys are header names, pointing to an array with its header value(s).

DNS queries will route to the address closest to their origin. Only valid when a rule's action is set to 'resolve'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--dns_resolvers))
- `egress` (Attributes) Configure how Gateway Proxy traffic egresses. You can enable this setting for rules with Egress actions and filters, or omit it to indicate local egress via WARP IPs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--egress))

- `insecure_disable_dnssec_validation` (Boolean) INSECURE - disable DNSSEC validation (for Allow actions).
- `ip_categories` (Boolean) Set to true to enable IPs in DNS resolver category blocks. By default categories only block based on domain names.

- `untrusted_cert` (Attributes) Configure behavior when an upstream cert is invalid or an SSL error occurs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_settings--untrusted_cert))
