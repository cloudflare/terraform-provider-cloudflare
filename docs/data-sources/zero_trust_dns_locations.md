# cloudflare_zero_trust_dns_locations (Data Source)




<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String)

### Optional

- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) The items returned by the data source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `client_default` (Boolean) True if the location is the default location.
- `created_at` (String)
- `dns_destination_ips_id` (String) The identifier of the pair of IPv4 addresses assigned to this location.
- `doh_subdomain` (String) The DNS over HTTPS domain to send DNS requests to. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ecs_support` (Boolean) True if the location needs to resolve EDNS queries.
- `endpoints` (Attributes) The destination endpoints configured for this location. When updating a location, if this field is absent or set with null, the endpoints configuration remains unchanged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints))
- `id` (String)
- `ip` (String) IPV6 destination ip assigned to this location. DNS requests sent to this IP will counted as the request under this location. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ipv4_destination` (String) The primary destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `ipv4_destination_backup` (String) The backup destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `name` (String) The name of the location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of network ranges that requests from this location would originate from. A non-empty list is only effective if the ipv4 endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--networks))
- `updated_at` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints`

Read-Only:

- `doh` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--doh))
- `dot` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--dot))
- `ipv4` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv4))
- `ipv6` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv6))

<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--doh"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.doh`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of allowed source IP network ranges for this endpoint. When empty, all source IPs are allowed. A non-empty list is only effective if the endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--doh--networks))
- `require_token` (Boolean) True if the endpoint requires [user identity](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/dns-over-https/#filter-doh-requests-by-user) authentication.

<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--doh--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.doh.require_token`

Read-Only:

- `network` (String) The IP address or IP CIDR.



<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--dot"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.dot`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of allowed source IP network ranges for this endpoint. When empty, all source IPs are allowed. A non-empty list is only effective if the endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--dot--networks))

<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--dot--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.dot.networks`

Read-Only:

- `network` (String) The IP address or IP CIDR.



<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv4"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.ipv4`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.


<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv6"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.ipv6`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of allowed source IPv6 network ranges for this endpoint. When empty, all source IPs are allowed. A non-empty list is only effective if the endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv6--networks))

<a id="nestedatt--result--endpoints--ipv6--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.endpoints.ipv6.networks`

Read-Only:

- `network` (String) The IPv6 address or IPv6 CIDR.




<a id="nestedatt--result--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.networks`

Read-Only:

- `network` (String) The IPv4 address or IPv4 CIDR. IPv4 CIDRs are limited to a maximum of /24.
