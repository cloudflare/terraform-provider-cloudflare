## Schema

### Required

- `zone_id` (String) Identifier.

- `internal_dns` (Attributes) Settings for this internal zone. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--internal_dns))

- `secondary_overrides` (Boolean) Allows a Secondary DNS zone to use (proxied) override records and CNAME flattening at the zone apex.
