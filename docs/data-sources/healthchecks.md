### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `address` (String) The hostname or IP address of the origin server to run health checks on.
- `check_regions` (List of String) A list of regions from which to run health checks. Null means Cloudflare will pick a default region.
- `consecutive_fails` (Number) The number of consecutive fails required from a health check before changing the health to unhealthy.
- `consecutive_successes` (Number) The number of consecutive successes required from a health check before changing the health to healthy.
- `created_on` (String)
- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the health check.
- `failure_reason` (String) The current failure reason if status is unhealthy.
- `http_config` (Attributes) Parameters specific to an HTTP or HTTPS health check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--http_config))
- `id` (String) Identifier
- `interval` (Number) The interval between each health check. Shorter intervals may give quicker notifications if the origin status changes, but will increase load on the origin as we check from multiple locations.

- `suspended` (Boolean) If suspended, no health checks are sent to the origin.
- `tcp_config` (Attributes) Parameters specific to TCP health check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--tcp_config))
