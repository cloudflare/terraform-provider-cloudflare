<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `pagerule_id` (String) Identifier
- `zone_id` (String) Identifier

### Read-Only

- `created_on` (String) The timestamp of when the Page Rule was created.
- `id` (String) Identifier
- `modified_on` (String) The timestamp of when the Page Rule was last modified.
- `priority` (Number) The priority of the rule, used to define which Page Rule is processed
over another. A higher number indicates a higher priority. For example,
if you have a catch-all Page Rule (rule A: `/images/*`) but want a more
specific Page Rule to take precedence (rule B: `/images/special/*`),
specify a higher priority for rule B so it overrides rule A.
- `status` (String) The status of the Page Rule.
Available values: "active", "disabled".
