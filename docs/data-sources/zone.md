# cloudflare_zone (Data Source)

Use this data source to look up [zone](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-properties)
info. This is the singular alternative to `cloudflare_zones`.

~> **Note** Cloudflare zone names **are not unique**. It is possible for multiple
accounts to have the same zone created but in different states. If you are
using this setup, it is advised to use the `account_id` attribute on this
resource or swap to `cloudflare_zones` to further filter the results.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudflare_zone" "example" {
  name = "example.com"
}

resource "cloudflare_record" "example" {
  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.example.id
  name    = "www"
  content = "203.0.113.1"
  type    = "A"
  proxied = true
}
```
