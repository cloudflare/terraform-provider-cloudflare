### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `allow_mode_switch` (Boolean) Whether to allow the user to switch WARP between modes.
- `allow_updates` (Boolean) Whether to receive update notifications when a new version of the client is available.
- `allowed_to_leave` (Boolean) Whether to allow devices to leave the organization.
- `auto_connect` (Number) The amount of time in seconds to reconnect after having been disabled.
- `captive_portal` (Number) Turn on the captive portal after the specified amount of time.
- `default` (Boolean) Whether the policy is the default policy for an account.
- `description` (String) A description of the policy.
- `disable_auto_fallback` (Boolean) If the `dns_server` field of a fallback domain is not present, the client will fall back to a best guess of the default/system DNS resolvers unless this policy option is set to `true`.
- `doh_in_tunnel` (Boolean) Determines how the WARP client sends DNS requests to Cloudflare Gateway. When `true`, DNS traffic is sent over DoH inside the WARP tunnel. When `false`, the DoH connection operates outside of the WARP tunnel.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the policy will be applied to matching devices.
- `exclude` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--exclude))

- `gateway_unique_id` (String)
- `include` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--include))
- `lan_allow_minutes` (Number) The amount of time in minutes a user is allowed access to their LAN. A value of 0 will allow LAN access until the next WARP reconnection, such as a reboot or a laptop waking from sleep. Note that this field is omitted from the response if null or unset.
- `lan_allow_subnet_size` (Number) The size of the subnet for the local access network. Note that this field is omitted from the response if null or unset.
- `match` (String) The wirefilter expression to match devices.
- `name` (String) The name of the device settings profile.
- `policy_id` (String) Device ID.
- `precedence` (Number) The precedence of the policy. Lower values indicate higher precedence. Policies will be evaluated in ascending order of this field.
- `register_interface_ip_with_dns` (Boolean) Determines if the operating system will register WARP's local interface IP with your on-premises DNS server.
- `service_mode_v2` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--service_mode_v2))
- `support_url` (String) The URL to launch when the Send Feedback button is clicked.
- `switch_locked` (Boolean) Whether to allow the user to turn off the WARP switch and disconnect the client.
- `target_tests` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--target_tests))
- `tunnel_protocol` (String) Determines which tunnel protocol to use.
