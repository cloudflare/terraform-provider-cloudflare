## Schema

### Required

- `zone_id` (String) Identifier

### Optional

- `comment` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--comment))
- `content` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--content))
- `direction` (String) Direction to order DNS records in.
Available values: "asc", "desc".
- `match` (String) Whether to match all search requirements or at least one (any). If set to `all`, acts like a logical AND between filters. If set to `any`, acts like a logical OR instead. Note that the interaction between tag filters is controlled by the `tag-match` parameter instead.
Available values: "any", "all".
- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000
- `name` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--name))
- `order` (String) Field to order DNS records by.
Available values: "type", "name", "content", "ttl", "proxied".
- `proxied` (Boolean) Whether the record is receiving the performance and security benefits of Cloudflare.
- `search` (String) Allows searching in multiple properties of a DNS record simultaneously. This parameter is intended for human users, not automation. Its exact behavior is intentionally left unspecified and is subject to change in the future. This parameter works independently of the `match` setting. For automated searches, please use the other available parameters.
- `tag` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tag))
- `tag_match` (String) Whether to match all tag search requirements or at least one (any). If set to `all`, acts like a logical AND between tag filters. If set to `any`, acts like a logical OR instead. Note that the regular `match` parameter is still used to combine the resulting condition with other filters that aren't related to tags.
Available values: "any", "all".
- `type` (String) Record type.
Available values: "A", "AAAA", "CAA", "CERT", "CNAME", "DNSKEY", "DS", "HTTPS", "LOC", "MX", "NAPTR", "NS", "OPENPGPKEY", "PTR", "SMIMEA", "SRV", "SSHFP", "SVCB", "TLSA", "TXT", "URI".

<a id="nestedatt--result--settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.settings`

Read-Only:

- `flatten_cname` (Boolean) If enabled, causes the CNAME record to be resolved externally and the resulting address records (e.g., A and AAAA) to be returned instead of the CNAME record itself. This setting is unavailable for proxied records, since they are always flattened.
- `ipv4_only` (Boolean) When enabled, only A records will be generated, and AAAA records will not be created. This setting is intended for exceptional cases. Note that this option only applies to proxied records and it has no effect on whether Cloudflare communicates with the origin using IPv4 or IPv6.
- `ipv6_only` (Boolean) When enabled, only AAAA records will be generated, and A records will not be created. This setting is intended for exceptional cases. Note that this option only applies to proxied records and it has no effect on whether Cloudflare communicates with the origin using IPv4 or IPv6.
