<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `account_id` (String)
- `filter` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))
- `location_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `client_default` (Boolean) True if the location is the default location.
- `created_at` (String)
- `dns_destination_ips_id` (String) The identifier of the pair of IPv4 addresses assigned to this location.
- `doh_subdomain` (String) The DNS over HTTPS domain to send DNS requests to. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ecs_support` (Boolean) True if the location needs to resolve EDNS queries.
- `endpoints` (Attributes) The destination endpoints configured for this location. When updating a location, if this field is absent or set with null, the endpoints configuration remains unchanged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ip` (String) IPV6 destination ip assigned to this location. DNS requests sent to this IP will counted as the request under this location. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ipv4_destination` (String) The primary destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `ipv4_destination_backup` (String) The backup destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `name` (String) The name of the location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of network ranges that requests from this location would originate from. A non-empty list is only effective if the ipv4 endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--networks))
- `updated_at` (String)

### Nested Schema for `endpoints.doh`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.

<a id="nestedatt--endpoints--dot"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoints.dot`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of allowed source IP network ranges for this endpoint. When empty, all source IPs are allowed. A non-empty list is only effective if the endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints--dot--networks))

<a id="nestedatt--endpoints--dot--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoints.dot.networks`

Read-Only:

- `network` (String) The IP address or IP CIDR.

### Nested Schema for `endpoints.ipv6`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the endpoint is enabled for this location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of allowed source IPv6 network ranges for this endpoint. When empty, all source IPs are allowed. A non-empty list is only effective if the endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints--ipv6--networks))

<a id="nestedatt--endpoints--ipv6--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoints.ipv6.networks`

Read-Only:
