## Schema

### Optional

- `account_id` (String)
- `filter` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))
- `location_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `client_default` (Boolean) True if the location is the default location.
- `created_at` (String)
- `dns_destination_ips_id` (String) The identifier of the pair of IPv4 addresses assigned to this location.
- `dns_destination_ipv6_block_id` (String) The uuid identifier of the IPv6 block brought to the gateway, so that this location's IPv6 address is allocated from the Bring Your Own Ipv6(BYOIPv6) block and not from the standard CloudFlare IPv6 block.
- `doh_subdomain` (String) The DNS over HTTPS domain to send DNS requests to. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ecs_support` (Boolean) True if the location needs to resolve EDNS queries.
- `endpoints` (Attributes) The destination endpoints configured for this location. When updating a location, if this field is absent or set with null, the endpoints configuration remains unchanged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ip` (String) IPV6 destination ip assigned to this location. DNS requests sent to this IP will counted as the request under this location. This field is auto-generated by Gateway.
- `ipv4_destination` (String) The primary destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `ipv4_destination_backup` (String) The backup destination IPv4 address from the pair identified by the dns_destination_ips_id. This field is read-only.
- `name` (String) The name of the location.
- `networks` (Attributes List) A list of network ranges that requests from this location would originate from. A non-empty list is only effective if the ipv4 endpoint is enabled for this location. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--networks))
- `updated_at` (String)
