## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudflare_workers_for_platforms_dispatch_namespaces" "example_workers_for_platforms_dispatch_namespaces" {
  account_id = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Identifier.

### Optional

- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) The items returned by the data source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `created_by` (String) Identifier.
- `created_on` (String) When the script was created.
- `modified_by` (String) Identifier.
- `modified_on` (String) When the script was last modified.
- `namespace_id` (String) API Resource UUID tag.
- `namespace_name` (String) Name of the Workers for Platforms dispatch namespace.
- `script_count` (Number) The current number of scripts in this Dispatch Namespace.
- `trusted_workers` (Boolean) Whether the Workers in the namespace are executed in a "trusted" manner. When a Worker is trusted, it has access to the shared caches for the zone in the Cache API, and has access to the `request.cf` object on incoming Requests. When a Worker is untrusted, caches are not shared across the zone, and `request.cf` is undefined. By default, Workers in a namespace are "untrusted".
