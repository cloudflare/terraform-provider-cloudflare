# cloudflare_healthcheck (Data Source)




<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `address` (String) The hostname or IP address of the origin server to run health checks on.
- `check_regions` (String) A list of regions from which to run health checks. Null means Cloudflare will pick a default region.
- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the health check.
- `find_one_by` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--find_one_by))
- `healthcheck_id` (String) Identifier
- `http_config` (Attributes) Parameters specific to an HTTP or HTTPS health check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--http_config))
- `name` (String) A short name to identify the health check. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
- `tcp_config` (Attributes) Parameters specific to TCP health check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tcp_config))
- `zone_id` (String) Identifier

### Read-Only

- `consecutive_fails` (Number) The number of consecutive fails required from a health check before changing the health to unhealthy.
- `consecutive_successes` (Number) The number of consecutive successes required from a health check before changing the health to healthy.
- `created_on` (String)
- `failure_reason` (String) The current failure reason if status is unhealthy.
- `id` (String) Identifier
- `interval` (Number) The interval between each health check. Shorter intervals may give quicker notifications if the origin status changes, but will increase load on the origin as we check from multiple locations.
- `modified_on` (String)
- `retries` (Number) The number of retries to attempt in case of a timeout before marking the origin as unhealthy. Retries are attempted immediately.
- `status` (String) The current status of the origin server according to the health check.
- `suspended` (Boolean) If suspended, no health checks are sent to the origin.
- `timeout` (Number) The timeout (in seconds) before marking the health check as failed.
- `type` (String) The protocol to use for the health check. Currently supported protocols are 'HTTP', 'HTTPS' and 'TCP'.
