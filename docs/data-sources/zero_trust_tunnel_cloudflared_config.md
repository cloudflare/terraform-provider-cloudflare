# cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config" "example_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config" {
  account_id = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
  tunnel_id = "f70ff985-a4ef-4643-bbbc-4a0ed4fc8415"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Identifier
- `tunnel_id` (String) UUID of the tunnel.

### Read-Only

- `config` (Attributes) The tunnel configuration and ingress rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `created_at` (String)
- `source` (String) Indicates if this is a locally or remotely configured tunnel. If `local`, manage the tunnel using a YAML file on the origin machine. If `cloudflare`, manage the tunnel's configuration on the Zero Trust dashboard.
- `version` (Number) The version of the Tunnel Configuration.

<a id="nestedatt--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config`

Read-Only:

- `ingress` (Attributes List) List of public hostname definitions. At least one ingress rule needs to be defined for the tunnel. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--ingress))
- `origin_request` (Attributes) Configuration parameters for the public hostname specific connection settings between cloudflared and origin server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--origin_request))
- `warp_routing` (Attributes) Enable private network access from WARP users to private network routes. This is enabled if the tunnel has an assigned route. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--warp_routing))

<a id="nestedatt--config--ingress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.ingress`

Read-Only:

- `hostname` (String) Public hostname for this service.
- `origin_request` (Attributes) Configuration parameters for the public hostname specific connection settings between cloudflared and origin server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--ingress--origin_request))
- `path` (String) Requests with this path route to this public hostname.
- `service` (String) Protocol and address of destination server. Supported protocols: http://, https://, unix://, tcp://, ssh://, rdp://, unix+tls://, smb://. Alternatively can return a HTTP status code http_status:[code] e.g. 'http_status:404'.

### Nested Schema for `config.ingress.origin_request`

Read-Only:

- `access` (Attributes) For all L7 requests to this hostname, cloudflared will validate each request's Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion request header. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--ingress--origin_request--access))
- `ca_pool` (String) Path to the certificate authority (CA) for the certificate of your origin. This option should be used only if your certificate is not signed by Cloudflare.
- `connect_timeout` (Number) Timeout for establishing a new TCP connection to your origin server. This excludes the time taken to establish TLS, which is controlled by tlsTimeout.
- `disable_chunked_encoding` (Boolean) Disables chunked transfer encoding. Useful if you are running a WSGI server.
- `http2_origin` (Boolean) Attempt to connect to origin using HTTP2. Origin must be configured as https.
- `http_host_header` (String) Sets the HTTP Host header on requests sent to the local service.
- `keep_alive_connections` (Number) Maximum number of idle keepalive connections between Tunnel and your origin. This does not restrict the total number of concurrent connections.
- `keep_alive_timeout` (Number) Timeout after which an idle keepalive connection can be discarded.
- `no_happy_eyeballs` (Boolean) Disable the “happy eyeballs” algorithm for IPv4/IPv6 fallback if your local network has misconfigured one of the protocols.
- `no_tls_verify` (Boolean) Disables TLS verification of the certificate presented by your origin. Will allow any certificate from the origin to be accepted.
- `origin_server_name` (String) Hostname that cloudflared should expect from your origin server certificate.
- `proxy_type` (String) cloudflared starts a proxy server to translate HTTP traffic into TCP when proxying, for example, SSH or RDP. This configures what type of proxy will be started. Valid options are: "" for the regular proxy and "socks" for a SOCKS5 proxy.
- `tcp_keep_alive` (Number) The timeout after which a TCP keepalive packet is sent on a connection between Tunnel and the origin server.
- `tls_timeout` (Number) Timeout for completing a TLS handshake to your origin server, if you have chosen to connect Tunnel to an HTTPS server.

### Nested Schema for `config.ingress.origin_request.access`

Read-Only:

- `aud_tag` (List of String) Access applications that are allowed to reach this hostname for this Tunnel. Audience tags can be identified in the dashboard or via the List Access policies API.
- `required` (Boolean) Deny traffic that has not fulfilled Access authorization.
- `team_name` (String)
