~> Certificate packs are not able to be updated in place and if
you require a zero downtime rotation, you need to use Terraform's meta-arguments
for [`lifecycle`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#lifecycle-lifecycle-customizations) blocks.
`create_before_destroy` should be suffice for most scenarios (exceptions are
things like missing entitlements, high ranking domain). To completely
de-risk rotations, use you can create multiple resources using a 2-phase change
where you have both resources live at once and you remove the old one once
you've confirmed the certificate is available.

{{ if .HasExample -}}
## Example Usage

{{codefile "terraform" .ExampleFile}}
{{- end }}
{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

{{ if .HasImport -}}
## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile}}
{{- end }}

While supported, importing isn't recommended and it is advised to replace the
certificate entirely instead.
