# cloudflare_waf_override

Provides a Cloudflare WAF override resource. This enables the ability to toggle
WAF rules and groups on or off based on URIs.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_waf_override" "shop_ecxample" {
  zone_id = "1d5fdc9e88c8a8c4518b068cd94331fe"
  urls    = [
    "example.com/no-waf-here",
    "example.com/another/path/*"
  ]

  # Disable rule ID 100015.
  rules = {
    "100015": "disable"
  }

  # Set to Cloudflare default action for group ID ea8687e59929c1fd05ba97574ad43f77.
  groups = {
    "ea8687e59929c1fd05ba97574ad43f77": "default"
  }

  # Update the actions for when a matching rule is encountered.
  rewrite_action = {
    "default": "block",
    "challenge": "block",
  }
}
```
