~> It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in most cases using either is fine.
   However, if you're using a scoped access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's
   scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com" zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.
   If 'application_id' is omitted, the policy created can be reused by multiple access applications.
   Any cloudflare_access_application resource can reference reusable policies through its `policies` argument.
   To destroy a reusable policy and remove it from all applications' policies lists on the same apply, preemptively set the
   lifecycle option `create_before_destroy` to true on the 'cloudflare_access_policy' resource.
