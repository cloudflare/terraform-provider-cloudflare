{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> It's required that an `account_id` or `zone_id` is provided and in
most cases using either is fine. However, if you're using a scoped
access token, you must provide the argument that matches the token's
scope. For example, an access token that is scoped to the "example.com"
zone needs to use the `zone_id` argument.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/resource.tf") }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/import.sh") }}
