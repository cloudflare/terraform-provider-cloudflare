# cloudflare_firewall_rule

Define Firewall rules using filter expressions for more control over how traffic is matched to the rule.
A filter expression permits selecting traffic by multiple criteria allowing greater freedom in rule creation.

Filter expressions needs to be created first before using Firewall Rule. See [Filter](filter.html).

If you want to configure Custom Firewall rules, you need to use [cloudflare_ruleset](ruleset.html), because Custom Rules are built upon the
[Cloudflare Ruleset Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_filter" "wordpress" {
  zone_id = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
  description = "Wordpress break-in attempts that are outside of the office"
  expression = "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1"
}

resource "cloudflare_firewall_rule" "wordpress" {
  zone_id = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
  description = "Block wordpress break-in attempts"
  filter_id = cloudflare_filter.wordpress.id
  action = "block"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `zone_id` - (Required) The DNS zone to which the Filter should be added.
- `action` - (Required) The action to apply to a matched request. Allowed values: "block", "challenge", "allow", "js_challenge", "managed_challenge", "bypass". Enterprise plan also allows "log".

## Import

Firewall Rule can be imported using a composite ID formed of zone ID and rule ID, e.g.

```
$ terraform import cloudflare_firewall_rule.default d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e/9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6
```

where:

- `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` - zone ID
- `9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6` - rule ID as returned by [API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-firewall-filter-rules)
