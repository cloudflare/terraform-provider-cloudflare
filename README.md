# Cloudflare Terraform Provider

## Quickstarts

- [Getting started with Cloudflare and Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/installing)
- [Developing the provider](contributing/development.md)

## Documentation

Full, comprehensive documentation is available on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs). [API documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com) and [Developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com) is also available
for non-Terraform or service specific information.

## Migrating to Terraform from using the Dashboard

Do you have an existing Cloudflare account (or many!) that you'd like to transition
to be managed via Terraform? Check out [cf-terraforming](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming)
which is a tool Cloudflare has built to help dump the existing resources and
import them into Terraform.
