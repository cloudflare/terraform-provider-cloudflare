+
+## Example Usage
+
+```terraform
+resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared" "example_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared" {
+  account_id = "699d98642c564d2e855e9661899b7252"
+  name = "blog"
+  config_src = "cloudflare"

+}
+```

+<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
+## Schema
+
+### Required
+
+- `account_id` (String) Cloudflare account ID
+- `name` (String) A user-friendly name for a tunnel.
+
+### Optional
+
+- `config_src` (String) Indicates if this is a locally or remotely configured tunnel. If `local`, manage the tunnel using a YAML file on the origin machine. If `cloudflare`, manage the tunnel on the Zero Trust dashboard.
+Available values: "local", "cloudflare".
+- `tunnel_secret` (String, Sensitive) Sets the password required to run a locally-managed tunnel. Must be at least 32 bytes and encoded as a base64 string.
+
+### Read-Only
+
+- `account_tag` (String) Cloudflare account ID
+- `connections` (Attributes List) The Cloudflare Tunnel connections between your origin and Cloudflare's edge. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--connections))
+- `conns_active_at` (String) Timestamp of when the tunnel established at least one connection to Cloudflare's edge. If `null`, the tunnel is inactive.
+- `conns_inactive_at` (String) Timestamp of when the tunnel became inactive (no connections to Cloudflare's edge). If `null`, the tunnel is active.
+- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of when the resource was created.
+- `deleted_at` (String) Timestamp of when the resource was deleted. If `null`, the resource has not been deleted.
+- `id` (String) UUID of the tunnel.
+- `metadata` (String) Metadata associated with the tunnel.
+- `remote_config` (Boolean) If `true`, the tunnel can be configured remotely from the Zero Trust dashboard. If `false`, the tunnel must be configured locally on the origin machine.
+- `status` (String) The status of the tunnel. Valid values are `inactive` (tunnel has never been run), `degraded` (tunnel is active and able to serve traffic but in an unhealthy state), `healthy` (tunnel is active and able to serve traffic), or `down` (tunnel can not serve traffic as it has no connections to the Cloudflare Edge).
+Available values: "inactive", "degraded", "healthy", "down".
+- `tun_type` (String) The type of tunnel.
+Available values: "cfd_tunnel", "warp_connector", "warp", "magic", "ip_sec", "gre", "cni".

+### Nested Schema for `connections`
+
+Read-Only:
+
+- `client_id` (String) UUID of the Cloudflare Tunnel connector.
+- `client_version` (String) The cloudflared version used to establish this connection.
+- `colo_name` (String) The Cloudflare data center used for this connection.
+- `id` (String) UUID of the Cloudflare Tunnel connection.
+- `is_pending_reconnect` (Boolean) Cloudflare continues to track connections for several minutes after they disconnect. This is an optimization to improve latency and reliability of reconnecting.  If `true`, the connection has disconnected but is still being tracked. If `false`, the connection is actively serving traffic.
+- `opened_at` (String) Timestamp of when the connection was established.
+- `origin_ip` (String) The public IP address of the host running cloudflared.
+- `uuid` (String) UUID of the Cloudflare Tunnel connection.
