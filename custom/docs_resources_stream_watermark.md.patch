+## Schema
+
+### Required
+
+- `account_id` (String) The account identifier tag.
+- `file` (String) The image file to upload.
+
+### Optional
+
+- `identifier` (String) The unique identifier for a watermark profile.
+- `name` (String) A short description of the watermark profile.
+- `opacity` (Number) The translucency of the image. A value of `0.0` makes the image completely transparent, and `1.0` makes the image completely opaque. Note that if the image is already semi-transparent, setting this to `1.0` will not make the image completely opaque.
+- `padding` (Number) The whitespace between the adjacent edges (determined by position) of the video and the image. `0.0` indicates no padding, and `1.0` indicates a fully padded video width or length, as determined by the algorithm.
+- `position` (String) The location of the image. Valid positions are: `upperRight`, `upperLeft`, `lowerLeft`, `lowerRight`, and `center`. Note that `center` ignores the `padding` parameter.
+- `scale` (Number) The size of the image relative to the overall size of the video. This parameter will adapt to horizontal and vertical videos automatically. `0.0` indicates no scaling (use the size of the image as-is), and `1.0 `fills the entire video.
+
+### Read-Only
+
+- `created` (String) The date and a time a watermark profile was created.
+- `downloaded_from` (String) The source URL for a downloaded image. If the watermark profile was created via direct upload, this field is null.
+- `height` (Number) The height of the image in pixels.
+- `size` (Number) The size of the image in bytes.
+- `uid` (String) The unique identifier for a watermark profile.
+- `width` (Number) The width of the image in pixels.
