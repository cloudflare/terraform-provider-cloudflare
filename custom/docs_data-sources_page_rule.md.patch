+## Schema
+
+### Required
+
+- `pagerule_id` (String) Identifier.
+- `zone_id` (String) Identifier.
+
+### Read-Only
+
+- `created_on` (String) The timestamp of when the Page Rule was created.
+- `id` (String) Identifier.
+- `modified_on` (String) The timestamp of when the Page Rule was last modified.
+- `priority` (Number) The priority of the rule, used to define which Page Rule is processed
+over another. A higher number indicates a higher priority. For example,
+if you have a catch-all Page Rule (rule A: `/images/*`) but want a more
+specific Page Rule to take precedence (rule B: `/images/special/*`),
+specify a higher priority for rule B so it overrides rule A.
+- `status` (String) The status of the Page Rule.
+Available values: "active", "disabled".
