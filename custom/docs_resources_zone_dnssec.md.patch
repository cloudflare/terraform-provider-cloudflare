+
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```terraform
+resource "cloudflare_zone_dnssec" "example_zone_dnssec" {
+  zone_id = "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353"
+  dnssec_multi_signer = false
+  dnssec_presigned = true
+  dnssec_use_nsec3 = false
+  status = "active"
+}
+```

+## Schema
+
+### Required
+
+- `zone_id` (String) Identifier.
+
+### Optional
+
+- `dnssec_multi_signer` (Boolean) If true, multi-signer DNSSEC is enabled on the zone, allowing multiple
+providers to serve a DNSSEC-signed zone at the same time.
+This is required for DNSKEY records (except those automatically
+generated by Cloudflare) to be added to the zone.
+
+See [Multi-signer DNSSEC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/multi-signer-dnssec/) for details.
+- `dnssec_presigned` (Boolean) If true, allows Cloudflare to transfer in a DNSSEC-signed zone
+including signatures from an external provider, without requiring
+Cloudflare to sign any records on the fly.
+
+Note that this feature has some limitations.
+See [Cloudflare as Secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/#dnssec) for details.
+- `dnssec_use_nsec3` (Boolean) If true, enables the use of NSEC3 together with DNSSEC on the zone.
+Combined with setting dnssec_presigned to true, this enables the use of
+NSEC3 records when transferring in from an external provider.
+If dnssec_presigned is instead set to false (default), NSEC3 records will be
+generated and signed at request time.
+
+See [DNSSEC with NSEC3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/enable-nsec3/) for details.
+- `status` (String) Status of DNSSEC, based on user-desired state and presence of necessary records.
+Available values: "active", "disabled".
+
+### Read-Only
+
+- `algorithm` (String) Algorithm key code.
+- `digest` (String) Digest hash.
+- `digest_algorithm` (String) Type of digest algorithm.
+- `digest_type` (String) Coded type for digest algorithm.
+- `ds` (String) Full DS record.
+- `flags` (Number) Flag for DNSSEC record.
+- `id` (String) Identifier.
+- `key_tag` (Number) Code for key tag.
+- `key_type` (String) Algorithm key type.
+- `modified_on` (String) When DNSSEC was last modified.
+- `public_key` (String) Public key for DS record.
+
+## Import
+
+Import is supported using the following syntax:
+
+```shell
+$ terraform import cloudflare_zone_dnssec.example '<zone_id>'
+```
